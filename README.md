   Hello
 My name is Tyler Maynard and I am a recent graduate of Lambda School. I am currently living in Mississippi, but I come from a small town in rural Washington state.  I am always looking to learn new skills and expand my knowledge when it comes to programming.
 
 As it stands I currently have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
